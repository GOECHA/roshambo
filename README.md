- A Game should include:
- Two Player instances
- A way to keep track of the data for the game board
- A way to keep track of the selected game type
- A way to check the Game‚Äôs board data for win conditions
- A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)

- A main.js file that contains all DOM related JavaScript
