    - Automatically reset the game board to allow for a new game to be played after the previous game is won
- 6.13
    - TBD Extension - Persist Player data using local storage (number of wins should persist across page refreshes)
    - Refactor 


## **Suggested Iterations**
This workflow is not required, but will help you meet the overall requirements of the project.

- Plan out the HTML layout (colors and icons do not need to match, but overall layout should closely match the demo video)
- Create the Player class
- Create the Game class
- Make game fully playable without the DOM (manually updating the Game data, etc, from your console) to force yourself to think data-model-first
- Create central game board on the DOM
- Connect Game data model to the DOM
- Display the Player data in the sidebars
- Automatically reset the game board to allow for a new game to be played after the previous game is won
- Extension - Persist Player data using local storage (number of wins should persist across page refreshes)


## **Objective**
- A timeout is used after a completed game to reset the board.
- No need to match colors or icons, but the overall layout should be the same. You can get as creative as you would like with your Rock Paper - - Scissors design!
- This game is played by one user against a computer. The computer player should be an instantiation of Player and have the ability to make a random choice.
- You’ll need to make two versions of Rock, Paper, Scissors - “classic” and some variation. The variation should include more than 3 options (the one in the video has 5). You can - - - - invent your own variation, or do some research on variations here. Make sure you communicate the rules to your user!
- Classic Rock Paper Scissors Rules


## **Game rule order**
- Rock smashes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock
